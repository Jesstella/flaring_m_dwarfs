PLOT DESCRIPTIONS 

P_kepler_all_seasons.png
What is shows: This plot shows every point on very Kepler module that is supplied in the supplemental information. Each color corresponds to a season given in the supplemental information (spring, summer, autumn, winter). 

Why it is useful: I used this information to decide which coordinates to use as the central coordinates in my TRILEGAL sample searches. I wanted to make sure that if I picked a specific season they would not differ too much with the rotation of Kepler. Because each of the points overlap for the different seasons, this plot shows that it won't matter too much which I choose. I chose spring. 

P_kepler_one_module.png
What is shows: This plot shows a zoom in for each of the points given on just one module of the CCD (in this case Module 2). The two black dots represent the two most central points of the module as given for the spring coordinates. 

Why it is useful: In order to choose the central coordinates for each of the TRILEGAL sample searches, I needed to know what indices they corresponded to in the supplemental data list, which was not intuative from the list itself. I used this plot to determine the order of the coordinates for each module and then saved the two central points. Because the modules are plotted as four sub-modules, I used the two central most pixels and found the average of their positions to determine the central point at which I should search.  

P_kepler_fov_all_modules.png
What is shows: This plot shows each of the Kepler modules, in a different colour, with the central two points highlighted in a darker shade. 

Why it is useful: This plot served as a check for me to make sure I had choosen the correct central points for each module.
